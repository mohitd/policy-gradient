# Policy Gradient

Implementation of policy gradients in Pytorch.

## Getting Started

Install the following prerequisites on your system

- pytorch
- torchvision
- opencv
- gym
- gym[atari]

To execute a policy gradient, run the `main.py` file.

```
python main.py
```

All of the policy gradient training and optimizer parameters are at the top of `main.py` so feel free to modify these to suit your configuration.

There are some parameter configurations on the command line. More will be added!

## Todos
- More command line configurations
- Train for a few days and post results
